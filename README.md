# Spatial dependence
 Spatial dependence is a model chain that generates the global synthetic dataset of spatially-dependent extreme sea levels events for the current climate. This dataset is comprised of 10,000 years of individual extreme events with realistic spatial dependence along the global coastline. There are two models on this GitHub page, namely Dependence model and K-Means clustering.
